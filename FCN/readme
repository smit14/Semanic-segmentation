First of all download vgg16.npy file from the link: ftp://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/mttt2/models/vgg16.npy and put it in the folder

This folder contains code for FCN models for semantic segmantation

To train the FCN32 model, run the following

python FCN32.py 0

The training parameters will be saved automatically. So, to run it again from the previous point, write following command

python FCN32.py 1



The same thing apply for FCN16 and FCN8 model.
